# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Dispatch API Request:

File(s):
components/Auth/Login.js initiates the request by dispatching actions.
Redux Middleware:

File(s):

API Call:

File(s):
api/apiClientBase.js creates an Axios instance configured for requests.
api/authApi.js handles specific API calls related to authentication.
API Config:

File(s):
api/apiEndpoints.js provides endpoint URLs for API requests.
API Interceptor:

Sending Request (Network Layer):

File(s):
Managed by Axios as configured in apiClientBase.js.
Server Processing:

File(s):
This is on the server-side and not directly represented in your files.
Database Interaction:

File(s):
This is on the server-side and not directly represented in your files.
Response Handling

Receiving Response:

File(s):
Managed by Axios as configured in apiClientBase.js.
API Interceptor (Response Handling):

File(s):
auth/apiInterceptor.js processes responses, including handling unauthorized errors.
API Call Completion:

File(s):
api/apiClientBase.js completes the API request and response cycle.
Redux Store Update:

File(s):
authSlice.js updates the Redux store based on API responses and authentication status.
Component Update:

File(s):
components/Auth/Login.js, components/Auth/Logout.js receive updated state from Redux.
User Feedback:

File(s):
components/Auth/Login.js provides feedback to the user based on authentication state.

# API Debugging Checklist

When encountering issues with API requests, go through this checklist:

1. **CSRF Token**

   - [ ] Verify that the CSRF token cookie is being set by the backend
   - [ ] Check if the CSRF token is correctly extracted in `apiClient.js`
   - [ ] Ensure the CSRF token is being sent with requests (check network tab)

2. **API Client Configuration**

   - [ ] Confirm BASE_URL in `apiClient.js` is correct
   - [ ] Verify `withCredentials: true` is set in axios config
   - [ ] Check that all necessary headers are being set (e.g., Content-Type)

3. **Backend Configuration**

   - [ ] Ensure CORS settings allow requests from your frontend origin
   - [ ] Verify CORS settings allow credentials
   - [ ] Check that all required endpoints are properly implemented and accessible

4. **Network Requests**

   - [ ] Use browser dev tools to inspect network requests
   - [ ] Verify that requests are being sent to the correct URL
   - [ ] Check response status codes and body for error messages

5. **Error Handling**

   - [ ] Review console for any JavaScript errors
   - [ ] Check server logs for backend errors
   - [ ] Ensure error responses from the API are being properly caught and logged

6. **Authentication**

   - [ ] Verify that authentication tokens (if used) are being properly set and sent
   - [ ] Check if authentication middleware on the backend is functioning correctly

7. **Data Flow**

   - [ ] Trace the data flow from the React component through services to the API client
   - [ ] Ensure that data is being properly transformed and passed at each step

8. **Environment**
   - [ ] Confirm that you're running the latest version of your code
   - [ ] Verify that all necessary environment variables are set correctly

By systematically going through this checklist, you can identify and resolve most common issues with API integration.

handling authentication tokens securely:

Use HttpOnly Cookies:
Store authentication tokens in HttpOnly cookies 45. This makes them inaccessible to JavaScript, significantly reducing XSS risks.
Implement Cookie Security Flags:
Set the following flags on your cookies 45:
HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript access
Secure: Ensures transmission over HTTPS
SameSite=Strict: Protects against CSRF attacks
Complement with CSRF Protection:
Implement a CSRF token mechanism alongside your authentication cookies 5.
This provides an additional layer of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
Use Short-Lived Tokens:
Implement short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens 5.
This limits the impact of a compromised token.
Implement Token Rotation:
Regularly rotate tokens, especially after significant events like password changes 5.
Server-Side Validation:
Always validate tokens on the server-side, never trust client-side validation alone 5.
Content Security Policy (CSP):
Implement a Content Security Policy to further mitigate XSS risks 5.
Avoid Client-Side Storage:
Do not store sensitive information like authentication tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage 45.
HTTPS Everywhere:
Ensure all communications between client and server use HTTPS 5.
Proper Session Management:
Implement proper session management, including secure logout procedures 5.
Regular Security Audits:
Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities 5.
By combining these measures, you create a robust security posture for handling authentication tokens. The HttpOnly cookie serves as the primary secure storage mechanism, complemented by additional layers of protection against various attack vectors.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Stay updated with the latest security best practices and regularly review and update your security measures to address emerging threats.
