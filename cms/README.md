# CMS Microservice Documentation

## Overview

This CMS microservice is designed to manage and deliver content within a web application. It utilizes a comprehensive stack of technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and ease of development. This document provides an overview of the technologies used, their rationale, and instructions for setting up and managing the CMS.

## Tool Stack

### Django

**Purpose:** Django serves as the primary web framework for the CMS. It is chosen for its robustness, ease of use, and comprehensive feature set, including an admin interface and built-in security features.

**Rationale:** Django's built-in features such as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication system, and admin panel significantly speed up development and reduce boilerplate code. Its strong community and extensive documentation further support its selection.

### PostgreSQL

**Purpose:** PostgreSQL is used as the database backend for storing content and application data.

**Rationale:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its advanced features, reliability, and performance. It supports complex queries and large datasets, making it suitable for handling a CMS's content needs.

### Gunicorn

**Purpose:** Gunicorn acts as the WSGI HTTP server for serving the Django application.

**Rationale:** Gunicorn is a lightweight, high-performance WSGI server that can handle multiple concurrent requests. It is compatible with various web servers and supports asynchronous workers, enhancing the application's scalability.

### Docker & Docker Compose

**Purpose:** Docker and Docker Compose are used for containerization and orchestration of the application's services.

**Rationale:** Docker ensures consistent environments across different stages of development, testing, and production. Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications, making it easier to define and run services.

### Summernote

**Purpose:** Summernote is a WYSIWYG editor integrated into Django for rich text editing.

**Rationale:** Summernote provides a user-friendly interface for content creation and editing, enhancing the CMS's usability. It supports various formatting options and integrates seamlessly with Django through the `django-summernote` package.

### Celery

**Purpose:** Celery is used for asynchronous task processing and background job management.

**Rationale:** Celery enables the execution of long-running tasks in the background, improving the responsiveness of the CMS. It integrates well with Django and supports various message brokers, including Redis.

### Redis

**Purpose:** Redis serves as the message broker for Celery.

**Rationale:** Redis is a fast, in-memory data structure store that provides high performance for Celery's task queuing. It supports various data structures and can handle large volumes of tasks efficiently.

### Prometheus

**Purpose:** Prometheus is used for monitoring and metrics collection.

**Rationale:** Prometheus offers powerful querying capabilities and a flexible data model for collecting and storing metrics. It integrates well with various applications and supports custom metrics, which is crucial for monitoring the CMS's performance.

### Grafana

**Purpose:** Grafana provides visualization and dashboarding for metrics collected by Prometheus.

**Rationale:** Grafana offers an intuitive interface for creating dashboards and visualizing metrics. It supports multiple data sources, including Prometheus, and enables users to monitor the CMS's performance through customizable visualizations.

### GitLab

**Purpose:** GitLab manages version control and CI/CD pipelines.

**Rationale:** GitLab offers a comprehensive suite of tools for version control, issue tracking, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). It facilitates collaboration, code review, and automated testing and deployment processes.

Installation and Setup
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required Python packages by installing them within the Django container:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web pip install -r requirements.txt
Integrate Summernote
Add Summernote to Django:

Install the Summernote Django package:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web pip install django-summernote
Update settings.py:

Add django_summernote to INSTALLED_APPS:

python
Copy code
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_summernote',
    ...
]
Configure URL Patterns:

Add Summernote URLs to your urls.py:

python
Copy code
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('summernote/', include('django_summernote.urls')),
    ...
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
Include Summernote in Templates:

Ensure your templates include the necessary Summernote static files and JavaScript:

html
Copy code
{% load static %}

<link href="{% static 'django_summernote/summernote.css' %}" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="{% static 'django_summernote/summernote.js' %}"></script>
Initialize Summernote in your JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#id_content').summernote({
        height: 300,
        // Customize your Summernote options here
    });
});
Integrate Celery
Install Celery:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web pip install celery redis
Configure Celery in settings.py:

Add Celery configurations:

python
Copy code
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://redis:6379/0'
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://redis:6379/0'
Create celery.py:

In your Django project directory, create celery.py:

python
Copy code
from __future__ import absolute_import, unicode_literals

    ...
  db:
    ...
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:

Running the Services
To start the CMS microservice and its dependencies, use Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This command will build and start the containers for the Django application, PostgreSQL database, Redis (for Celery), Prometheus, and Grafana.

Database Migrations
Once the services are up and running, apply the initial database migrations:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
Creating a Superuser
Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin interface:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set up the superuser credentials.

Accessing the Application
Django Admin: Visit http://localhost:8000/admin to access the Django admin interface. Log in with the superuser credentials you created.
Django Application: Visit http://localhost:8000 to access the main application interface.
Grafana: Visit http://localhost:3000 to access Grafana for monitoring and visualization.
Stopping the Services
To stop and remove the containers, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Summernote Editor Not Showing: Ensure that Summernote's JavaScript and CSS files are correctly included in your templates and that there are no JavaScript errors in the browser console.
Application Fails to Start: Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in the .env file and that the services are properly defined in docker-compose.yml.
Database Connection Errors: Verify that the PostgreSQL container is running and that the database credentials match those in the .env file.
Viewing Logs
To view logs for specific services, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs web
docker-compose logs db
Replace web or db with the appropriate service name as defined in your docker-compose.yml.

Development
Adding New Features
To add new features, update the Django application code within the cms_django_app directory. Use standard Django development practices, including creating new models, views, and templates.

Running Tests
Run tests using:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
Ensure that all tests pass before deploying changes.

Deployment
For deployment, consider using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to orchestrate containers in a production environment. Ensure that production environment variables and settings are properly configured.
